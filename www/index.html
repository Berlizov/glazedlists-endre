<h1>A better way to browse lists</h1>
<p>Suppose you have a list of 1,000 objects to browse. With Glazed Lists, you can:
<p><strong>Sort</strong> the list by whichever criterea you specify via either of the Comparable or Comparator interfaces. Sorting criteria can be changed as necessary by the user.
<p><strong>Filter</strong> the list to display only those that are relevant. You could type "foo" to limit the list to only items containing the string "foo".
<p><strong>Change</strong> the list to add, update and remove items as the source list changes in real time. If your list contained rows from a dynamic database table, changes to the data would be reflected in your list.
<p><strong>Display</strong> the list in a JTable or JComboBox. By using Glazed Lists' custom renderers, you can make your Java Swing application look great.


<p><h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>Glazed Lists uses <strong>event-driven lists</strong>. When a change to a list is made, it notifies all <code>ListChangeListeners</code> of the change. This is the same mechanism Swing uses to send events about user activity.
<p>Start with a <strong>source list</strong>. A <code>BasicEventList</code> can contain all of the unsorted, unfiltered objects. It can be used just like an ArrayList, with all the <code>add()</code>, <code>remove()</code> and <code>get()</code> methods from the <code>List</code> interface.
<p>Then add a <strong>mutation list</strong>. It provides a mutated view of the source list. When the source list is changed, the mutation list receives a notification to update itself. For example, the <code>SortedList</code> provides a sorted view of a source list. When an object is added to the source list it is simultaneously added to the SortedList in sorted order. The <code>FilterList</code> is a mutation list which views a subset of the source list.
<p>Finally it is possible to create <strong>widgets</strong> to display the contents of an event list. A <code>ListTable</code> is a <code>JTable</code> that displays the contents of a list. When its source list is modified the <code>ListTable</code> is notified and updates the display table. There is also a <code>JComboBox</code> widget. It is straightforward to create custom Glazed List widgets for Swing, SWT or even Servlets.
