<h1>A Case for Glazed Lists on the Network</h1>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>A growing number of client applications are taking advantage of networks
to share data effectively. A consequence of all of this data-sharing is that
there is a copy of the data for each of many connected user. If data is
updated, all copies must be updated so that clients are not viewing stale data. 

<h3>Polling Solution</h3>
<p>This problem is typically solved by clients that query a central server for
updates on a specified interval. The limitations on this polling approach are
that the client may ask too frequently and waste network resources, or it may ask
too infrequently and have stale data.

<h3>Push Solution</h3>
<p>The server can push updates to the client as they arrive. The limitations on this
are that the cost to notify all clients of all updates is expensive and that clients
may not all be accessible (addressable) by the server.

<h3>Refined Push Solution</h3>
<p>The server cost problem is solved with peer-to-peer networking such that clients
propagate updates to each other. The unaddressable client problem is solved with
HTTP/1.1 such that clients initiate a connection to a server (or peer) and updates
are pushed back over that connection.  

<h3>Specification</h3>
<p>Update Subscription Protocol (USP) will be specified as a standard way for
servers to send updates to interested clients. This protocol specification
shall include security, peer-to-peer network layout, GIVE connections for
reaching unaddressable clients, keep-alive messages and timeouts. A reference
implementation will be created in Java. 
 
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>Glazed Lists will use USP to provide list subscriptions across the network.
List subscriptions can be used immediately in applications to eliminate stale
data and polling.
