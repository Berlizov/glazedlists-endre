<h1>A Case for Glazed Lists on the Network</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>To design and implement a protocol for pushing data updates to clients
connected on a network. For example, multiple users each have a copy
of a dataset. When one user modifies the dataset, other network connected
users are notified.

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Traditional solutions to this problem use a strategy called "polling". This
involves clients querying a central server for updates on a specified interval.
Limitations of this approach are that the client may ask too frequently (wasting
network resources), or it may ask too infrequently (and have stale data).

<p>Our "push" approach does not suffer these problems. This involves a server
pushing updates to the clients as updates arrive. 

<p>Push suffers some inherent limitations as well. Traditional push requires an
expensive, high-performance server to notify all clients of all updates.
Also, some clients may not be accessible (addressable) by the server and
therefore unable to receive updates.

<p>We can overcome these limitations in our design. To reduce the requirement
from the server, we will implement peer-to-peer updating. Clients will forward
updates to other clients without the server's intervention. To address all
clients, our protocol sits on top of the web protocol, HTTP. Clients requesting
updates will create a connection to the server or a peer, and the updates will
be pushed back using that connection.  

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p><strong>1. Update Subscription Protocol (USP) specification.</strong><br>
Describe the wire protocol for client connect and server push. This
includes specification of: 
<li>security
<li>peer-to-peer network layout
<li>GIVE connections for reaching unaddressable clients
<li>keep-alive messages and timeouts
 
<p><strong>2. Update Subscription Protocol (USP) implementation.</strong><br>
<p>Create software client and server capable of communicating with USP using
the Java programming language. This includes both client and server
implementation of:
<li>simplified web protocol (ie. HTTP/1.1) with chunked encoding
<li>security using Java Cryptography Extension, JCE
<li>peer to peer strategy using dual-parents and child priorities

<p><strong>3. Glazed Lists on the Network</strong><br>
Implement a sample application that uses USP to subscribe and publish
updates to lists of data. This includes the Glazed Lists client and server
which use the USP implementation. 

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Networked client applications maintain private copies of data that have a
tendancy to become stale. Traditional approaches can suffer from excessive network
usage, stale data, expensive server requirements and unreachable clients. With
Glazed Lists on the network we overcome these problems by using peer-to-peer
networking and web protocols.
